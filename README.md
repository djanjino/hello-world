# hello-world
my first lesson
This is my first time editing a file in github. I am learning how to use github and the terms used in its context, which is quite challenging. Why do we have to use "commit" when "save" would have also worked? The branching concept is also interesting. It implies that git is built like a tree, let see if that's true. The main branch is the trunc of the tree, whatever you modifiy or add becomes a branch to eventually being added to the tree trunc.
